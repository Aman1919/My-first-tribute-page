    <h3>About Albert Einstein</h3>
<p>
    Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
    development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern
    physics.</p> 
    <p>
    His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the
    world's most famous equation".His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
</p> 
<p>
    He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery
    of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual
    achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius"
</p>
<p>His intellectual
achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius" In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.
</p>

    <p> These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special
    relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no
    longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity.
   </p>
   <p>
        He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his
    theory of gravitation
</p>
<p>
    In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[13][14] He continued to
    deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the
    motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which
    laid the foundation of the photon theory of light
